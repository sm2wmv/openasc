# Hey Emacs, this is a -*- makefile -*-
#
# WinAVR Sample makefile written by Eric B. Weddington, JÃ¼rg Wunsch, et al.
# Released to the Public Domain
# Please read the make user manual!

# Additional material for this makefile was submitted by:

#
# On command line:
#
# make all = Make software.
#
# make clean = Clean out built project files.
#
# make coff = Convert ELF to AVR COFF (for use with AVR Studio 3.x or VMLAB).
#
# make extcoff = Convert ELF to AVR Extended COFF (for use with AVR Studio
#                4.07 or greater).
#
# make program = Download the hex file to the device, using avrdude.  Please
#                customize the avrdude settings below first!
#
# make filename.s = Just compile filename.c into the assembler code only
#
# To rebuild project do "make clean" then "make all".

# will not be considered source files but generated files (assembler
# output from the compiler), and will be deleted upon "make clean"!
# Even though the DOS/Win* filesystem matches both .s and .S the same,
# it will preserve the spelling of the filenames, and gcc itself does
# care about how the name is spelled on its command-line.
