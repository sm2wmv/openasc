# WinAVR Sample makefile written by Eric B. Weddington, JÃ¼rg Wunsch, et al.

# On command line:
#
# make all = Make software.
#
# make clean = Clean out built project files.#
# make coff = Convert ELF to AVR COFF (for use with AVR Studio 3.x or VMLAB).
#
# make extcoff = Convert ELF to AVR Extended COFF (for use with AVR Studio
#                4.07 or greater).
#
# make program = Download the hex file to the device, using avrdude.  Please
#                customize the avrdude settings below first!
#
# make filename.s = Just compile filename.c into the assembler code only
#
# To rebuild project do "make clean" then "make all".
